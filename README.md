togomak is a powerful, build pipeline orchestration tool, and a drop-in 
replacement for your CI/CD execution environment that could run anywhere. 

![Demo](./examples/demo/screenrecord.gif)


`togomak` is inspired from Terraform lifecycle for infrastructure as code (IaC) 
to create a context free, concurrent pipeline evaluation and orchestration engine
to simplify your local builds and your CI/CD pipelines.

Okay, enough talk, let's see some code.

## Getting Started

`togomak` uses [HCL (Hashicorp Language)][hcl] to define pipelines 
declaratively. If you are already familiar with Terraform, this becomes
a piece of cake. 

Here is a sample `togomak.hcl` file:
```hcl 
togomak {
  version = 2
}

data "prompt" "repo_name" {
  prompt = "enter repo name: "
  default = "username/repo"
}

locals {
  repo = "srevinsaju/togomak"
  lint_tools = ["misspell", "golangci-lint", "abcgo"]
  build_types = ["amd64", "i386", "arm64"]
}

stage "lint" {
  script = <<-EOT
  echo ðŸ’… running style checks for repo ${local.repo}
  %{ for tool in local.lint_tools }
  echo "* running linter: ${tool}"
  sleep 1
  %{ endfor }
  EOT
}


stage "build" {
  script = <<-EOT
  echo ðŸ‘· running ${ansifmt("green", "build")}
  %{ for arch in local.build_types }
  echo "* building ${local.repo} for ${arch}..."
  sleep 1
  %{ endfor }
  EOT
}

stage "deploy" {
  if = data.prompt.repo_name.value == "srevinsaju/togomak"
  depends_on = [stage.build]
  container {
    image = "hashicorp/terraform"
  }
  args = ["version"]
}
```

simple, isn't it?
