togomak is a powerful, build pipeline orchestration tool, and a drop-in 
replacement for your CI/CD execution environment that could run anywhere. 

![Demo](./examples/demo/screenrecord.gif)


`togomak` is inspired from Terraform lifecycle for infrastructure as code (IaC) 
to create a context free, concurrent pipeline evaluation and orchestration engine
to simplify your local builds and your CI/CD pipelines.

Okay, enough talk, let's see some code.

## Getting Started

`togomak` uses [HCL (Hashicorp Language)][hcl] to define pipelines 
declaratively. If you are already familiar with Terraform, this becomes
a piece of cake. 

```hcl 
togomak {
  version = 2
}

stage "hello" {
    script = "echo hello world"
}
```

simple, isn't it?

### Documentation
* We have a WIP [documentation](https://togomak.srev.in/v1) (also available over [docs](./docs) directory)

* Plugins (wip, [use v0][v0] for plugin support)
* Macros (reusable stages)
* Terraform-like data sources
